# Accreted: AI-Powered Universe Building

Welcome to Accreted – a collaborative project to create a universe system by system and planet by planet using AI-generated text descriptions. Think of it as vibe coding for cosmology: relaxed, creative, and community-driven. Users contribute by adding folders for planets, sharing AI prompts, and expanding the lore.

## Project Goals
- Build a shared universe through descriptive text (e.g., geography, ecosystems, civilizations).
- Use AI tools (like ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion for text-to-image if extended) to generate content.
- Foster collaboration: Share prompts in the /prompts folder and planets as subfolders in /systems.

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo or clone it: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Accreted.git`.
2. Explore existing systems in /systems.
3. Create a new planet: Add a folder in /systems/[system-name]/[planet-name], then include a description.md file.

## Contribution Guidelines
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
- Planets: Use folders for organization. Each planet folder should have at least one Markdown file with AI-generated text.
- Prompts: Add to /prompts as .md or .txt files, e.g., "earth-like-planet-prompt.md".

## Example
Check /examples for a starter planet.

Let's accrete this universe together!

# Contributing to Accreted

Thanks for helping build this universe! Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-planet`.
2. **Add a Planet**:
   - Navigate to /systems/[system-name] (create if new).
   - Add a subfolder [planet-name].
   - Inside, create description.md with AI-generated text (e.g., "A lush world with floating islands and bioluminescent oceans.").
   - Optionally, add images or metadata files.
3. **Share Prompts**:
   - In /prompts, add a file like [prompt-name].md.
   - Example content: "Generate a description for a desert planet with ancient ruins using AI: 'Describe a harsh desert world orbiting a red dwarf star, including lost civilizations and unique flora.'"
4. **Commit and PR**: Use clear messages, e.g., "Add new planet: Xerion in Vega System".
5. **Rules**:
   - Keep descriptions original and AI-assisted.
   - No offensive content.
   - Vibe: Creative, fun, and expansive – like coding with a cosmic twist.
